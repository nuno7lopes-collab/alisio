# Community Plugins

Community plugins are third-party packages that extend Alisio with new
channels, tools, providers, or other capabilities. They are built and maintained
by the community, published on [Local Marketplace](/tools/marketplace) or npm, and
installable with a single command.

```bash
alisio plugins install <package-name>
```

Alisio checks Local Marketplace first and falls back to npm automatically.
